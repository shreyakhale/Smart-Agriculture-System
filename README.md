Smart-Agriculture-System

Smart agriculture is an emerging concept as IOT sensors are capable of providing information about agriculture fields and then act based on the user input. 
In this project, I developed a SMART AGRICULTURE SYSTEM that uses advantages of cutting-edge technologies such as Arduino & IOT Sensor Networks. 

The project aims at making use of evolving technology i.e. IOT and smart agriculture using automation.
Monitoring environmental conditions is the major factor to improve yield of the efficient crops. 

The features of this project includes development of a system which can monitor
- Rain through raindrops sensor,
- Soil moisture through moisture detection sensor and
- Movements on the farm through Proximity (PIR) sensor
- Along with relay module, water pump, Arduino, breadboard, etc. and notify results in the output.
- In the Smart Irrigation section, the pump starts when the moisture detected is low and the raindrops sensor shows ‘Clear’ atmosphere.
